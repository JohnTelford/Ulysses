<p>My radio journey commenced with the family multi band radio that included some amateur radio and foreign broadcast bands. I particularly enjoyed listening to Voice of America, South American, Australian, and others short wave stations. Listening to amateur radio bands also piqued my interest.</p>

<h2 id="amater-radio">Amater Radio</h2>

<p>Learning about basic radios. Transmitters, and antennas at the city library, and building a crystal radio able to receive local AM signals without external power.</p>

<h2 id="licensing">Licensing</h2>

<p>Studying and passing FCC tests for novice and general amateur radio licenses, with a focus on Morse Code practicing reception and transmission using a homemade transistor audio oscillator and Morse key.</p>

<h2 id="commercial-license">Commercial License</h2>

<p>My next endeavor was to prepare for and take the Federal Communications Commission test for a First Class Commercial license. This license is essential for individuals responsible for operating and maintaining broadcast transmitters, particularly in roles such as chief engineer at a broadcast station or in work related to television transmitters.</p>

<h1 id="electronic-components">Electronic Components</h1>

<p>The journey began with receiving an Allied Electronics catalog, sparking interest in both familiar and new components.</p>

<h2 id="learning-resources">Learning Resources</h2>

<p>I expanded my knowledge through subscriptions to weekly and monthly electronics periodicals, which introduced new components and equipment and provided application insights.</p>

<p>Bookstores, both local and in other cities, served as important sources of new books for my growing technical library, although some books were occasionally outdated.</p>

<p>The Internet and Artificial Intelligence are transformative for technology learning, replacing the manual collection and analysis of information from varied sources.</p>

<p>Utilizing an RSS (Really Simple Syndication) Internet application daily enables track technologies of interest.</p>

<h2 id="junior-college">Junior College</h2>

<p>My academic journey in electronic engineering commenced during my enrollment at a technology junior college.</p>

<p>During my studies, I continued a keen interest in electronic components and the utilization of electronic instruments, particularly oscilloscopes.</p>

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed electronic circuits, components, vacuum tubes and transistors classes. Laboratories involved constructing circuits and measuring various electronic parameters.</p>

<h2 id="engineering-college">Engineering College</h2>

<p>My subsequent academic pursuit in electronic engineering entailed enrolling in a four-year Electronics Engineering Bachelor Degree program.</p>

<h3 id="math-and-science">Math and Science</h3>

<p>In parallel with Electronic Engineering classes, mathematics and physics classes were aligned with Electronic Engineering theory classes</p>

<h3 id="circuit-analysis-software">Circuit Analysis Software</h3>

<p>An intriguing aspect of one class was to describe a circuit to an electronic circuit analysis software program that analyzed circuits and printed out computed parameters. The results of the circuit I described were a significant revelation for me.</p>

<h3 id="electromagnetic-interference-emi">Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)</h3>

<p>The success of physical circuit design is influenced by the physical reality of component tolerances and EMI generated by component or circuits unintentionally affecting the operation of other components or circuits. EMI is usually difficult to measure and mitigate.</p>

<h3 id="software">Software</h3>

<p>Software engineering is easier to address errors because they are more traceable and fixable compared to hardware EMI. </p>

<h3 id="senior-project">Senior Project</h3>

<p>The final year of Electronic Engineering classes included designing, developing, and documenting a Senior Project before graduation.</p>

<p>I developed a Fortran program using Fourier transforms to analyze waveforms, with verification using lab instruments, and oscilloscope calibration.</p>

<h3 id="microcode">Microcode</h3>

<p>Microcode is a low-level code within a CPU that defines how the processor implements its instruction set and controls its behavior</p>

<p>microcode is essential for modern CPU design, serving as a microprogrammed control layer that interprets machine instructions and controls internal CPU operations dynamically</p>

<p>Microcode acts as an abstraction layer between the machine code instructions a programmer writes and the underlying hardware signals</p>

<p>Microcode is a specialized type of firmware embedded within the CPU itself. It provides low-level instructions that translate complex machine instructions into simpler, more fundamental operations that control the CPU’s internal circuits. Essentially, microcode acts as an intermediary, converting higher-level CPU instructions into detailed control signals that direct hardware behavior. It is stored in a special control memory inside the processor.</p>

<h2 id="the-control-data-6600">The Control Data 6600</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/search/3995c0cc-d38b-49a6-bcf0-274350fefc97"> [DESIGN OF A COMPUTER. THE CONTROL DATA 6600 ]</a></p>

<p>My first computer job was running and programming this computer.</p>

<figure><img src="6600.png" title="CDC 6600"/></figure>

<blockquote>
<p>Seymour Cray was renowned for developing the CDC 6600 at Control Data Corporation, where his innovations in architecture—such as instruction pipelining, parallel execution, and the use of multiple peripheral processors—transformed high-performance computing. The CDC 6600, introduced in 1964, is widely regarded as the world&#39;s first supercomputer and was almost ten times faster than any prior computer, executing up to 3 million instructions per second. Cray&#39;s simplified and efficient designs also anticipated concepts found in today&#39;s RISC processors.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="architectural-innovations">Architectural Innovations</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Cray focused on minimizing component size and wiring length, reducing signal delays and allowing for faster clock speeds (the CPU operated at 10 MHz, far beyond most contemporaries).​</p>

<p>He devised a simplified central processor built for rapid logic and arithmetic, placing it at the heart of the machine&#39;s cross-shaped chassis, surrounded by circuit boards compactly arranged to maximize speed and minimize interference.​</p>

<p>The 6600 featured ten peripheral processors dedicated to I/O and housekeeping, letting the central processor focus exclusively on computations—a revolutionary design that foreshadowed modern multiprocessing and parallel architectures.​</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="component-and-cooling-engineering">Component and Cooling Engineering</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Cray exploited the emerging technology of silicon transistors (much faster than previous germanium types), allowing the CPU to execute instructions in fewer cycles at higher speeds.​</p>

<p>He innovated assembly methods, using &quot;cordwood&quot; module construction to densely pack circuitry and keep wiring short, further boosting performance.​</p>

<p>Cray developed a robust cooling system using Freon (and in later designs, liquid nitrogen) for the modules, reducing thermal noise and ensuring reliability at high speeds.​</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="design-philosophy-and-team">Design Philosophy and Team</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Cray insisted on quiet, small teams, moving his lab to Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin for minimal management interference and maximal engineering focus.​</p>

<p>With a team of just 14 engineers and 4 programmers, Cray emphasized elegant simplicity, cutting instruction sets to essentials and maximizing throughput.​</p>

<p>The 6600&#39;s custom operator console replaced hundreds of switches and lights with screens and keyboards—an interface leap for the era.​</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="legacy">Legacy</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The CDC 6600’s architecture enabled major advances in scientific computing (simulating weather, nuclear reactions, and more) and sold over 100 units worldwide.​</p>

<p>Cray’s methods—parallel processing, simplified instruction sets, extreme physical and electrical efficiency—set foundations for future supercomputers and inspired industry rivals.​</p>

<p>Cray&#39;s meticulous focus on speed, simplicity, and parallelism—while leveraging groundbreaking transistor and cooling technology—made the CDC 6600 a quantum leap for computing performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="cpu">Cpu</h2>

<p>“In the 6600 Computer, perhaps even more than in any previous computer, the control system is the difference. The essential premise of the Central Processor is &quot;functional parallelism.&quot; Chapter V has dealt with the functional units. This chapter will show the methods employed to control these units in parallel.</p>

<p>It is well to repeat the essentials of the &quot;functional parallelism&quot; of the</p>

<p>6600 Computer. These are:</p>

<p>• Separate functional units,</p>

<p>• Registers for operands, indexes, and addresses,</p>

<p>• Instruction Stack,</p>

<p>• Reservation control, or Scoreboard.</p>

<p>This last is the major part of the control system. There are, of course,</p>

<p>other elements of the control system are also essential. For example,</p>

<p>the operating system for the 6600 provides overall control of job scheduling,</p>

<p>allocation of CPU and storage, and the control of Input and Output.”</p>

<h2 id="scoreboard">Scoreboard</h2>

<p>“A unique and essential part of the 6600 Central Processor control is the</p>

<p>Unit and Register Reservation Control, or the Scoreboard. What is intended by this design is the simultaneous operation of functional units on a single instruction stream. Many operations in these units are quite independent of others, due to the relative simplicity of the instructions. It is often particularly apparent that a sequence of arithmetic or logical operations can be executed simultaneously with a sequence of control or house-keeping operations. Again, examples will be shown in which considerable overlap is possible even in the single sequence.</p>

<p>One major premise of the Scoreboard design is that each new instruction be issued to its functional unit as early as possible to allow flowing instructions to be issued. In some cases, an issued instruction may be held up after issue awaiting input operands, while a following instruction may proceed without restraint.”</p>

<h2 id="peripheral-processors">Peripheral Processors</h2>

<p>The processing requirements in an input-output section of any computer include the following.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Transferring data between peripheral device and central storage.</li>
	<li>Controlling the initiation of peripheral device actions.</li>
	<li>Establishing priorities between devices.</li>
	<li>Buffering data between asynchronous devices.</li>
	<li>Interrupting the central processor for execution of priority tasks.</li>
</ul>

<p>This list is not exhaustive but illustrates the nature of the processing assigned to the ten small processors in the 6600 Computer.</p>

<p>These Peripheral and Control Processors, or PPU’s, are constructed within the main frame cabinet of the 6600. This provides convenient use of identical logic and storage modules as in the central processor and central storage, plus the shared use of the power and cooling system. It also allows a unique form of design, called the “barrel.”</p>

<h2 id="dead-start---166">Dead Start - 166</h2>

<p>A typical obstacle to the understanding of a complex instrument is the inability to discover the answer to the question, “How does it start?” This section is devoted to answering that question.</p>

<p>A first assumption is made that there are peripheral devices capable of loading the computer’s operating system. These may be:</p>

<p>Magnetic tape</p>

<p>Punched cards</p>

<p>Magnetic disk.</p>

<p>A second assumption is made that a direct entry of “machine language” programs is possible from these devices. To activate the DEAD START sequence, the 6600 cabinet contains a panel containing several control switches and a 12 by 12 matrix of switches.</p>

<figure><img src="Dear%20Start.png" title="Dead Start"/></figure>

<h2 id="the-control-data-7600">The Control Data 7600</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The CDC 7600 was a landmark supercomputer designed by Seymour Cray for Control Data Corporation and introduced in 1969, achieving top global computing speeds for much of the 1970s. It succeeded the CDC 6600, retaining code compatibility while dramatically increasing performance, and is well-known for its innovative hardware engineering and influence on later CPU design principles.<br/>Key technical features include:</p>

<p>Performance: Achieved speeds exceeding 10 MIPS (millions of instructions per second), with floating-point throughput up to 40 megaflops. It typically ran five times faster than the CDC 6600.</p>

<p>Memory: Utilized a small-core memory of 65,536 60-bit words with a 27-nanosecond clock cycle.</p>

<p>Architecture: Streamlined instruction issue logic compared to the CDC 6600, enabling one instruction per cycle pipelined, in-order execution without the complex scoreboard out-of-order logic of its predecessor.</p>

<p>Hardware: Used high-speed discrete transistors in multi-board modules at a time when competitors were switching to integrated circuits.</p>

<p>Design: Its large, U-shaped chassis provided efficient cooling and minimized wire lengths for reliability and speed.</p>
